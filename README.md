MULITINGUAL_CRYPTOGRAPHY
========================

I have used the phrase "Multilingual Cryptography" to refer to computer programs which permit the users to send their message in one or more languages, where the language can be selected dynamically, either at the time of invocation of the program or subsequently during its execution.
